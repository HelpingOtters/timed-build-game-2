#Phase 1: Reading and Displaying the .gif Files
Use what you learned about how to instantiate an Icon object to represent any .gif, .jpg or other image file on your disk and then place that Icon on a JLabel.  In Phase 1, we simply create an array of 57 JLabels, attach the 57 .gif files to them, and display the labels, unstructured, in a single JFrame.  Here is a possible main() that you can use as a starting point. You don't have to use my main() but yours should be no longer.  Look at your images folder to see the names of each .gif file:  you have to be able to construct their names in a loop (big point loss if you list all 52 cards named literally because this is array logic).  Where is the card-back image stored?  Find it in the images folder.

#public class Assig5 
{
   // static for the 57 icons and their corresponding labels
   // normally we would not have a separate label for each card, but
   // if we want to display all at once using labels, we need to.
   
   static final int NUM_CARD_IMAGES = 57; // 52 + 4 jokers + 1 back-of-card image
   static Icon[] icon = new ImageIcon[NUM_CARD_IMAGES];
      
   static void loadCardIcons()
   {
      // build the file names ("AC.gif", "2C.gif", "3C.gif", "TC.gif", etc.)
      // in a SHORT loop.  For each file name, read it in and use it to
      // instantiate each of the 57 Icons in the icon[] array.
   }
   
   // turns 0 - 13 into "A", "2", "3", ... "Q", "K", "X"
   static String turnIntIntoCardValue(int k)
   {
      // an idea for a helper method (do it differently if you wish)
   }
   
   // turns 0 - 3 into "C", "D", "H", "S"
   static String turnIntIntoCardSuit(int j)
   {
      // an idea for another helper method (do it differently if you wish)
   }
   
   // a simple main to throw all the JLabels out there for the world to see
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      int k;
      
      // prepare the image icon array
      loadCardIcons();
      
      // establish main frame in which program will run
      JFrame frmMyWindow = new JFrame("Card Room");
      frmMyWindow.setSize(1150, 650);
      frmMyWindow.setLocationRelativeTo(null);
      frmMyWindow.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
      
      // set up layout which will control placement of buttons, etc.
      FlowLayout layout = new FlowLayout(FlowLayout.CENTER, 5, 20);   
      frmMyWindow.setLayout(layout);
      
      // prepare the image label array
      JLabel[] labels = new JLabel[NUM_CARD_IMAGES];
      for (k = 0; k < NUM_CARD_IMAGES; k++)
         labels[k] = new JLabel(icon[k]);
      
      // place your 3 controls into frame
      for (k = 0; k < NUM_CARD_IMAGES; k++)
         frmMyWindow.add(labels[k]);

      // show everything to the user
      frmMyWindow.setVisible(true);
   }
